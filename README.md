# Project : Simple Calculator

# Description:
This Java program is a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

# How it Works:
- The program starts by displaying a menu to the user, listing the available operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The user is prompted to enter their choice of operation by entering a number (1, 2, 3, or 4) corresponding to the desired operation.
- The user is then prompted to enter two numbers, which will be used as the operands for the chosen operation.
- The program uses a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the user's choice.
- The program performs the chosen operation and stores the result in a variable called result.
- If the user chooses division and the second number is zero, the program displays an error message and exits.
- If the user enters an invalid choice, the program displays an error message and exits.
- Finally, the program displays the result of the operation to the user.
  
# Features
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations
- Handles division by zero error
- Handles invalid user input
- Displays the result of the operation to the user

# Code Organization
The program's logic is contained within a single main method, providing a clear and concise entry point for the application.

- User Input and Interaction:
  A Scanner object is utilized to facilitate user input, allowing the program to prompt the user for their operation choice and the required numerical values.
- Operation Selection and Execution
  A switch statement is used to determine the operation to be performed, based on the user's selection. This enables the program to execute the correct arithmetic operation, whether it be addition, subtraction, 
  multiplication, or division, using the inputted values.
- Error Handling and Validation
  The program incorporates basic error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure robustness and reliability. For example, it checks for division by zero and invalid user input, displaying error messages and 
  exiting the program as necessary.
